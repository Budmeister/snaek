# To Do
1. ~~Fix volcano level so that ridges do not diverge~~
2. Food and powerups no longer spawn naturally. Player spawns with 10 coins.
3. Instead of shop, give the player 3 powerups to choose from, randomly chosen (but unique) and with their respective prices. 
4. Plants grow food and earn coins (but not visibly). If you eat food, you get longer. The coins are spent in the shop. At the end of the level, your length is converted to coins to calculate score. Length is more valuable than coins.
5. Add Shovel powerup: lets you pick up one piece of dirt and place it back down later.
6. Invincibility is an on-demand powerup
7. Explosion only decreases elevation and does nothing else
