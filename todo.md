# To Do
1. Add MSPT meter: For draw and logic threads: "{lock} + {processing} / {max}" - in red if lock + processing > max
2. Water and Lava flow downhill
3. Water and Lava have a "height" value that, along with the elevation, determines where they flow
4. When water and lava meet, one "height" of each gets turned into one elevation
5. Seed "dist" value has a max speed of 1 per tick
6. Food no longer spawns naturally, but Gold does
7. Powerups spawn less frequently
8. Add shop where you can spend Gold for all powerups
9. Add Shovel powerup: lets you pick up one piece of dirt and place it back down later
10. Invincibility is an on-demand powerup
11. Explosion also decreases elevation
